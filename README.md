# CREATING A BASIC WEB APPLICATION USING NODE.JS
This code is from a WBF presentation at QueryClick.

## Installation
1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. CD to where you want the application to be saved from git.
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/QueryClick/creating-a-basic-web-application-using-nodejs.git`
4. Install packages `npm i`


## Running the application
1. CD to your applications directory
2. Within the parent directory run `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the application.

**Note:** Anytime you make a change to the source code, you will have to stop the server and start it again. If you install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), you can run `nodemon index.js` and it will watch for changes and automatically reload the server!
